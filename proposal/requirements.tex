The unit must send the appropriate control signals to the HVAC system. & The appropriate system (heating or A/C) should be activated as necessary to control the environmental temperature.\\
\hline
The system will control the temperature of the priority rooms such that the temperature index is within $\pm 1.5^{\circ}{\rm C}$. & The temperature index of the priority rooms should be within the specified range.\\
\hline
The system will control the temperature of the non-priority rooms such that the temperature index is within $\pm 3.5^{\circ}{\rm C}$. & The temperature index of the non-priority rooms should be within the specified range.\\
\hline
The unit must receive the data from the individual sensor units. & The unit should take specified measures to control the temperature of the rooms.\\
\hline
The unit will send commands to the vent control units to open and close the vents as necessary to control the climate in each room. & The vent control units should open or close as directed by the central control unit.\\
\hline
The unit will display the desired temperature index. & The unit should display the user set temperature index. \\
\hline
The unit will have manual control to set a priority room and adjust the desired temperature. & The desired temperature should be displayed.\\
\hline
{\it (If time permits)}
The unit will connect to a wireless network (802.11) to interface with a PC to set the desired temperature index and priority rooms. & The unit should acknowledge the packets sent to it over the network and adjust the climate accordingly. \\

\subsection{Tolerance Analysis}
The accuracy of the temperature sensor in the temperature sensing unit is critical to the performance of the system.  The accuracy will be determined by comparing the output of the temperature sensor to that of a thermometer with a known error over a period of seven days.  If the error of the temperature sensor is not within specifications, the analysis will fail.
