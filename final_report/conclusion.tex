\section{Ethical Considerations}
\subsubsection{Ethics}
The Smart Climate Control System is designed to make the lives of our customers more comfortable. Although we adhered to the entire IEEE Code of Ethics one stood out as the most relevant to our project.
\begin{quote}
To accept responsibility in making decisions consistent with the safety, health, and welfare of the public, and to disclose promptly factors that might endanger the public or the environment.
\end{quote}
We as engineers are committed to providing safe, reliable and ethical designs.  Should any unforseen danger with our system present itself, we would be ethically bound to notify our clients as soon as possible.

\subsubsection{Safety}
Electrocution: The fact that this is an electrical device brings the concern that all consumers as well as engineers may be exposed to electric shock. The highest power source we will deal with is the 120 VAC (RMS) wall outlet. While the engineers are making or testing this device they need to take safety precautions to prevent electrocution, such as the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Ensure that all power sources are off until you are certain your system is ready to be tested.
\item
Ensure that final product has the internal circuitry sealed to prevent accidental exposure to the consumer.
\end{enumerate}

Another safety consideration will be due to soldering during the production of this system. The soldering irons are extremely hot when on and engineers need to make sure they are aware of whether it's on before using it.

When soldering the engineers need to be sure not to inhale the fumes from the solder. Be sure to work in a well ventilated area and take steps to not inhale these fumes.

Since we'll be working with electricity as well as soldering irons it is possible that a fire could occur. To help prevent this occurrence the engineers will have to ensure that the power systems and soldering irons are off when not in use, and are handled properly when in use. This includes turning off everything before leaving for the day.
