Many buildings develop temperature gradients between rooms.  This is undesireable and in many cases leads to rooms being too warm or cold for comfort.  Traditional HVAC controls do not account for this, which the ``Smart Climate Control System'' attempts to rectify.  The system consists of a main control panel, which takes place of a traditional thermostat; temperature sensors in each room to monitor the individal room's temperature; and vent controllers in each room to open and close the vent to better control the room's temperature.
