SeniorDesign
============

Repository for senior design code and documentation.

The basic workflow is:
	git clone	- Creates copy of remote repository
	git pull	- Gets latest changes
	git add		- add new files
	git commit	- commit and describe changes
	git push	- upload changes to GitHub

There is more to these commands, see the help for details (e.g. git help add).
